Why it matters

Kicker:
Why it matters

Headline:
Information is growing faster than teams can act on it

Body:
Most tools help you store or find knowledge. Knowledge Agents help you operate on knowledge—turning documents into decisions, actions, and evidence-backed outcomes.

Value cards:
	1.	Automate expert review
Agents handle first-pass review so experts focus on judgment and strategy.
	2.	Standardize decisions
Apply consistent rules and outputs across teams, regions, and vendors.
	3.	Increase confidence
Every outcome ties back to evidence—ready for audit and leadership review.

New Knowledge Management

Headline:
From knowledge storage → to knowledge execution

Body:
Traditional KM helps teams capture and find information (wikis, search, portals). Knowledge Agents go further: they turn knowledge into operational decisions and actions—consistently, at scale, and with evidence.

Cards:
	1.	Knowledge → Structured outputs
Convert documents into fields, tables, and datasets teams can use in workflows.
	2.	Knowledge → Decisions
Apply rules to generate pass/fail, completeness indicators, and risk flags.
	3.	Knowledge → Actioning
Route exceptions, trigger reviews, and generate evidence packs automatically.

Use Cases

Headline:
Three high-ROI use cases

Body:
Click a use case to see what the agent produces: structured outputs, pass/fail rules, and evidence-backed summaries.

Use Case 1 — Finance

Title: Invoice validation & exceptions
Description: Extract invoice fields, reconcile against PO/policy rules, and flag exceptions with evidence before they hit close.

Bullets:
	•	Automated extraction: Invoice #, vendor, date, line items, tax, totals, payment terms
	•	Rules & reconciliation: Match against PO/GRN or policy thresholds (duplicates, tolerances)
	•	Exception workflow: Flag missing fields, mismatches, duplicates, or out-of-policy spend
	•	Audit-ready evidence: Tie every exception back to exact supporting source content

Example output (simplified):
	•	invoice_id, vendor, invoice_date, amount_total, payment_terms
	•	checks array with pass/fail
	•	status: REVIEW_REQUIRED

Use Case 2 — Legal / Compliance

Title: Contract clause & policy checks
Description: Standardize contract review by detecting required clauses and flagging deviations from playbooks and policies.

Bullets:
	•	Clause detection: Termination, indemnity, liability caps, confidentiality, renewals
	•	Policy compliance: Check against standard language and risk thresholds
	•	Deviation summaries: Highlight what changed and why it matters for approval
	•	Evidence-linked outputs: Provide citations to exact sections for counsel and audit trails

Example output (simplified):
	•	required_clauses with present true/false
	•	risk_flags with severity and evidence
	•	overall_status: NON_STANDARD_REVIEW

Use Case 3 — M&A / Private Equity

Title: Diligence red flags & readiness scoring
Description: Review large deal rooms quickly and surface what matters: risks, gaps, and a readiness score with evidence packs.

Bullets:
	•	Red-flag detection: Customer concentration, unfavorable terms, litigation, covenants
	•	Completeness scoring: Identify missing documents and unanswered diligence requests
	•	Executive summaries: Board-ready briefs: key risks, mitigation, and next steps

FAQ

FAQ

Headline:
Common questions

Intro:
If you want, we can tailor an Early Access demo to your exact workflow.

Q: What is a Knowledge Agent?
A Knowledge Agent is an AI-powered digital analyst that reads documents, extracts key facts into structured outputs, evaluates against business rules, and explains results with evidence.

Q: How is this different from AI search or a chatbot?
Search helps you find information. Knowledge Agents produce operational outputs (tables, pass/fail decisions, risk flags) with repeatability and traceability—so teams can act confidently.

Q: How does this relate to Knowledge Management?
Traditional KM focuses on storing and retrieving knowledge. Knowledge Agents add decisioning and actioning: they apply rules to knowledge sets and produce governed outcomes you can operationalize.

Q: How do we correct wrong outputs?
Use Knowledge Cards to fix a fact once and keep future results aligned—without retraining models. Corrections become part of your governed knowledge layer.
